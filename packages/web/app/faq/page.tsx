				q: "What is an Agent Skill?",
				a: "An Agent Skill is a markdown document (SKILL.md) with YAML frontmatter that instructs AI coding agents — such as Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex — how to work with specific products, frameworks, and patterns. Skills look like documentation but are treated as executable instructions by agents with file system and shell access.",
			},
			{
				q: "What is a SKILL.md file?",
				a: 'A SKILL.md file is the standard format for Agent Skills, defined by the Agent Skills spec. It contains YAML frontmatter with metadata (name, description, compatibility) followed by markdown content that teaches an AI agent how to use a particular technology correctly and safely. The compatibility field uses the format "package@version" (e.g., "react@^19.0.0"). The legacy product-version field is still supported as a fallback.',
			},
			{
				q: "What is skills-check?",
				a: "skills-check is the quality and integrity layer for Agent Skills. It answers whether your skills are correct, safe, current, and efficient by providing commands for freshness detection, security auditing, metadata linting, token budget analysis, semver verification, policy enforcement, and eval testing.",
			},
			{
				q: "How is skills-check different from linters or security scanners?",
				a: (
					<>
						Traditional linters check code syntax and style, while security scanners look for
						vulnerabilities in dependencies. skills-check is purpose-built for SKILL.md files — it
						detects{" "}
						<Link href="/commands/audit">hallucinated packages, prompt injection patterns</Link>,
						version drift against live registries, and measures the token cost of loading skills
						into an agent&apos;s context window.
					</>
				),
			},
		],
	},
	{
		category: "Freshness",
		questions: [
			{
				q: "How do I check if my AI agent skills are up to date?",
				a: (
					<>
						Run <code>npx skills-check check</code> to compare the <code>compatibility</code> (or
						legacy <code>product-version</code>) in each skill&apos;s frontmatter against the latest
						version on npm. The <Link href="/commands/check">check command</Link> reports which
						skills have drifted and by how many versions, with <code>--ci</code> mode for pipeline
						integration.
					</>
				),
			},
			{
				q: "How do I automatically update stale agent skills?",
				a: (
					<>
						The <Link href="/commands/refresh">refresh command</Link> uses an LLM to propose
						targeted updates to stale skill files. Run <code>npx skills-check refresh</code> to
						fetch changelogs, generate diffs, and optionally apply changes. It supports Anthropic,
						OpenAI, and Google providers.
					</>
				),
			},
			{
				q: "What is version drift in agent skills?",
				a: (
					<>
						Version drift occurs when the <code>compatibility</code> (or legacy{" "}
						<code>product-version</code>) field in a skill&apos;s frontmatter falls behind the
						latest release on npm. This means the skill may contain outdated instructions,
						deprecated APIs, or missing features. The{" "}
						<Link href="/commands/check">check command</Link> detects this automatically.

		category: "Security",
		questions: [
			{
				q: "How do I audit SKILL.md files for security issues?",
				a: (
					<>
						Run <code>npx skills-check audit</code> to scan your skill files. The{" "}
						<Link href="/commands/audit">audit command</Link> checks for hallucinated packages that
						don&apos;t exist on registries, prompt injection patterns, dangerous shell commands,
						dead URLs, and metadata gaps. Output formats include terminal, JSON, Markdown, and SARIF
						for GitHub Security integration.
					</>
				),
			},
			{
				q: "How do I detect hallucinated packages in agent skills?",
				a: (
					<>
						The <Link href="/commands/audit">audit command</Link> extracts every package reference
						from your skill files and verifies each one exists on npm, PyPI, or crates.io. It also
						cross-references against a database of known hallucinated packages identified by
						security researchers. Run <code>npx skills-check audit</code> to check your skills.
					</>
				),
			},
			{
				q: "What is prompt injection in agent skills?",
				a: (
					<>
						Prompt injection in agent skills occurs when a SKILL.md file contains instructions that
						attempt to override the agent&apos;s behavior — such as ignoring previous instructions,
						exfiltrating data, or executing obfuscated commands. The{" "}
						<Link href="/commands/audit">audit command</Link> scans for these patterns as part of
						its security checks.
					</>

		category: "Quality",
		questions: [
			{
				q: "How do I lint SKILL.md files?",
				a: (
					<>
						Run <code>npx skills-check lint</code> to validate metadata completeness and format. The{" "}
						<Link href="/commands/lint">lint command</Link> checks for required frontmatter fields,
						structural quality, SPDX license identifiers, and semver formatting. Use{" "}
						<code>--fix</code> to auto-populate missing fields from git context.
					</>
				),
			},
			{
				q: "How do I measure the token cost of agent skills?",
				a: (
					<>
						The <Link href="/commands/budget">budget command</Link> counts tokens using the
						cl100k_base encoding, shows per-skill and per-section breakdowns, detects redundancy
						between skills via n-gram similarity, and estimates costs across model pricing tiers.
						Run <code>npx skills-check budget</code> to analyze your skills.
					</>
				),
			},
			{
				q: "How do I verify semver bumps for agent skills?",
				a: (
					<>
						Run <code>npx skills-check verify</code> to validate that content changes between skill
						versions match the declared semver bump. The{" "}
						<Link href="/commands/verify">verify command</Link> uses heuristic rules and optionally
						LLM-assisted semantic analysis to detect dishonest or accidental version changes.
					</>

	{
		category: "CI/CD",
		questions: [
			{
				q: "How do I enforce skill quality in CI/CD?",
				a: (
					<>
						Every skills-check command supports <code>--ci</code> mode for strict exit codes and{" "}

						in a pipeline — for example, run <Link href="/commands/audit">audit</Link>,{" "}
						<Link href="/commands/lint">lint</Link>, and <Link href="/commands/budget">budget</Link>{" "}
						together to gate pull requests on security, metadata quality, and token cost.

				q: "How do I use skills-check as a GitHub Action?",
